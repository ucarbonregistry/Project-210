# Project-210
7.9 MW Biomass based Cogeneration Project at Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh (UCR# 210)

The project activity is a biomass based cogeneration plant installed of total capacity 7.9 MW, located in
Village: Hariawan District: Hardoi Uttar Pradesh of India. The project activity is promoted by DCM Shriram
Ltd (Distillery Unit Hariawan) (henceforth referred as DCM). The purpose of the project activity is to install
one 55 TPH biomass fired boiler and a 7.9 MW turbine to cater the electricity and steam demand of
distillery unit of DCM. Surplus power generated from the system exported to grid. 

DURING THE MR 01
The project activity has supplied 1,108,828.2 MT/12/ of process steam and generated 202.778 GWh
(Gross generation) in this crediting period both for captive consumption and grid export. In absence of this
project, equivalent amount of steam would have been sourced from a fossil fuel (i.e. Coal) fired boiler and
electricity would have been sourced from grid which is mainly dominated by fossil fuel. The project
activity, for this monitoring period, thus reduces 347,673 t-CO2e greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
collectively by avoiding fossil fuel combustion for steam, power usages from grid and surplus green power
supplied to the grid.
